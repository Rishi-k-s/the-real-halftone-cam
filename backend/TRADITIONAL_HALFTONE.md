# Traditional Halftone Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented an enhanced traditional halftone algorithm based on the reference implementation from [anderoonies.github.io/projects/halftone/](https://anderoonies.github.io/projects/halftone/). This provides significantly better halftone quality compared to the original algorithm.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Proper Rotation Handling**
- **Before**: Simple rotation with potential sampling issues
- **After**: Proper screen rotation with boundary calculation, following the traditional halftone printing process

### 2. **Better Dot Size Calculation**  
- **Before**: Linear mapping that could produce inconsistent results
- **After**: Accurate mapping of grayscale values to circle radius using the `map_value` function (value, 0, 255, dot_size/2, 0)

### 3. **Enhanced Grid Sampling**
- **Before**: Basic grid iteration
- **After**: Rotated grid iteration with proper back-transformation for sampling

### 4. **Improved Bounds Checking**
- **Before**: Simple bounds check
- **After**: Comprehensive boundary calculation for rotated screens

## Algorithm Comparison

### Traditional Algorithm (`traditional: true`)
```python
# Rotated grid iteration
for grid_y in range(min_y, max_y, dot_resolution):
    for grid_x in range(min_x, max_x, dot_resolution):
        # Sample from rotated position
        sample_x, sample_y = rotate_point_back(grid_x, grid_y)
        pixel_value = sample_image(sample_x, sample_y)
        
        # Map to circle radius
        circle_radius = map_value(pixel_value, 0, 255, dot_size/2, 0)
        draw_circle(grid_x, grid_y, circle_radius)
```

### Original Algorithm (`traditional: false`)
```python
# Simple grid with rotation
for y in range(min_y, max_y, dot_resolution):
    for x in range(min_x, max_x, dot_resolution):
        rotated_x, rotated_y = rotate_point(x, y)
        pixel_value = sample_image(rotated_x, rotated_y)
        dot_radius = calculate_radius(pixel_value)
        draw_circle(rotated_x, rotated_y, dot_radius)
```

## API Usage

### Traditional Halftone (Recommended)
```json
{
  "mode": "halftone",
  "traditional": true,
  "dot_size": 10,
  "dot_resolution": 8,
  "screen_angle": 45.0,
  "invert": false
}
```

### Original Halftone (Legacy)
```json
{
  "mode": "halftone", 
  "traditional": false,
  "dot_size": 10,
  "dot_resolution": 8,
  "screen_angle": 45.0,
  "invert": false
}
```

## Parameter Guide

### `dot_size` (Maximum dot diameter)
- **3-4**: Very fine, newspaper-style halftone
- **6-8**: Fine detail halftone  
- **10-12**: Classic halftone appearance
- **15+**: Bold, artistic halftone

### `dot_resolution` (Spacing between dots)
- **2-3**: Very tight spacing (dense pattern)
- **4-6**: Normal spacing
- **8-10**: Wide spacing (more visible dots)

### `screen_angle` (Rotation in degrees)
- **0°**: Horizontal lines
- **15°**: Slight diagonal
- **45°**: Classic diagonal (traditional)
- **75°**: Steep diagonal

## Test Results

Generated test files with the input image:

1. **`traditional_fine_dots_45deg.png`**
   - dot_size: 6, dot_resolution: 4, screen_angle: 45°
   - Fine detail halftone with classic diagonal pattern

2. **`traditional_medium_dots_15deg.png`**  
   - dot_size: 12, dot_resolution: 8, screen_angle: 15°
   - Medium-sized dots with subtle angle

3. **`traditional_newspaper_dots_0deg.png`**
   - dot_size: 3, dot_resolution: 2, screen_angle: 0°
   - Very fine dots similar to newspaper printing

4. **`original_algorithm_comparison.png`**
   - Same parameters as medium test but using original algorithm
   - Shows the difference in quality

## Quality Comparison

The traditional algorithm produces:
- ✅ More accurate dot patterns
- ✅ Better tonal gradation
- ✅ Cleaner rotation handling
- ✅ More consistent results across different angles
- ✅ Closer match to reference implementation

## Implementation Details

The traditional halftone is implemented in the `HalftoneProcessor.generate_traditional_halftone()` method in `halftone.py`. It follows these key steps:

1. **Load and convert image to grayscale**
2. **Calculate rotated screen boundaries** 
3. **Iterate over rotated grid positions**
4. **For each grid position:**
   - Rotate back to sample original image
   - Map grayscale value to circle radius
   - Draw circle at grid position
5. **Save result**

The algorithm is now the default (`traditional: True`) and provides significantly better halftone quality matching your reference examples.
